I kindly request your immediate approval to isolate the following servers from the network:

[Server 1 Name]
[Server 2 Name]
[Server 3 Name] (and any others involved)
This urgent action is necessary due to critical security concerns identified in recent logs on these servers. Evidence suggests potential:

Malicious activity: Commands associated with malware and hacking tools, including dnschef, easside-ng, dotdotpwn.pl, and dnsmap.
Vulnerability exploitation: Tools like enumiax and firewalk indicate attempts to identify and exploit weaknesses.

Unauthorized access: A "critical file accessed" log entry targeting /etc/shadow (password storage) raises serious concerns.
