Following our previous notification about suspicious activity on your servers, I have an urgent update with a strong recommendation.

The findings:

Logs show commands associated with malware and hacking tools.
Tools suggest attempts to exploit server vulnerabilities.
A critical file access raises concerns about potential data compromise.
Our recommendation:

we strongly recommend decommissioning the affected servers and deploying new ones. This minimizes risk of residual vulnerabilities and allows for faster service restoration.

Decommission the affected servers.
Deploy new servers with secure configurations.
